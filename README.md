## Description
    This challenge focuses on using node to create a README generator thru the command line. This markdown generator will help with future projects by quickly being made in the terminal, or command line.  We were given a started code that had empty functions no details of the README. I created a title, badges, description, Installation, usage, contributing guidelines and tests using inputs, checkbox, confirms, and lists types in my line of questions. I have also included a license badge and also a link to open VS code if you prefer to have that option.  There is also a license link listed at the bottom if you need to read the terms and conditions for the license chosen.  This assignment has taught me how to use js with node and have them link to other files and dependencies.  

## Installation

In order to use this application, open the command line and go down to the proper directory. enter "npm i" to install npm and it's dependencies.  

## Usage

In order to use this README markdown generator, set your command line to the right directory path and complete the npm installation in the command line.  Once that is done, run "node index.js".  You will be prompt with a list of questions pertaining to the sections of the README. Once the last question is asked, you will see a markdown file in the current folder with all of the detailed inputs!
